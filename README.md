Modification of the CQT package with minimal size and dependency published by https://github.com/xli2522 for SHARCNET (ComputeCanada) Supercomputer Clusters, that was a previous modification of gwpy (https://gwpy.github.io/docs/stable/) because some libraries went out of date wrt updates in scipy.

```None
